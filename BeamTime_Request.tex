\section{Beam Time Request}
With this proposal and beam time request, we ask for 100 days of beam time. Of the 100 days, 80 days will be dedicated to the production beam time with the standard CLAS setup, at full luminosity ($\sim 10^{35} \mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$) with 75\% torus field. The remaining 20 days will be dedicated to optimizing and testing the trigger set-up (HTCC +PCAL + EC). This request should provide a competitive data sample of $\etaP \to \epem \gamma$ and $\phi \to \epem \eta$. The CLAS12 configuration we propose for the measurement of the transition form factors is compatible with the experimental setup already established by Run Group A.
