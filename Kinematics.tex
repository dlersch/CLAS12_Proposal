\section{Kinematics}\label{sec:kinematics}

Write the kinematics of dalitz decays, and also of gamma gamma decays. Illustrate how the gamma can externally convert into a \epem pair and discuss how the use of the SVT, with 50-65 $\mu$ m can this overcome background since a resolution of 1mm vertex resolution is needed.
