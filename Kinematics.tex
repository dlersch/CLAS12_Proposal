\section{Kinematics}\label{sec:kinematics}
The main decays studied for this analysis are when a pseudoscalar meson, $P_p$($\eta'$), decays via 2 photons $\gamma \gamma$ or a photon $\gamma$ and a dilepton ($l^{+}l^{-}$) and when a vector meson $V_p$($\phi$), decays via an \etaT \  and a photon $\gamma$ or an $\eta$ and a dilepton ($l^{+}l^{-}$). This section will briefly discuss the physics of each decay.

Write the kinematics of dalitz decays, and also of gamma gamma decays. Illustrate how the gamma can externally convert into a \epemT pair and discuss how the use of the SVT, with 50-65 $\mu$ m can this overcome background since a resolution of 1mm vertex resolution is needed.
